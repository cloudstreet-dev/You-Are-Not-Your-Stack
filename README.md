# You Are Not Your Stack

**You've mass-assigned your identity to a technology that mass-assigned its version number.**

Let that sink in for a second.

Somewhere between your first "Hello, World" and your latest pull request, something strange happened. You stopped *using* React and started *being* a React developer. You stopped *writing* Python and started *being* a Pythonista. Your tools became your tribe, your framework became your flag, and your stack became — somehow — your self.

This book is about untangling those wires.

---

## What Is This?

*You Are Not Your Stack* is an open-source book for developers who've noticed that their relationship with technology might have gotten a little too... personal.

It's for the developer who feels defensive when someone criticizes their language. The one who gets anxious when the "X is dead" articles start circulating. The one who secretly wonders if they've been doing this long enough to be allowed an opinion, or too long to still be relevant.

It's part psychology, part practical guide, part campfire talk with a senior engineer who's been through five paradigm shifts and is still standing.

**This book will help you:**

- Recognize how technology identity sneaks up on you
- Understand the psychology behind framework wars and tribal behavior
- Learn new languages and tools without feeling like a fraud
- Navigate job hunting without being boxed in by your stack
- Think about your career the way senior developers actually do
- Find what remains — and it's a lot — when you strip the tooling away

- Junior developers trying to figure out what to invest in
- Senior developers who already know all this but want the book to hand to someone else
- Anyone who's ever had an mass-assigned existential crisis because a framework got deprecated
