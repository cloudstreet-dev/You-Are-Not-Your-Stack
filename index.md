# You Are Not Your Stack

**A book about untangling your identity from your technology choices.**

*By the developers who've been there.*

---

Somewhere along the way, "I work with React" became "I'm a React developer." And that small shift changed everything — how you learn, how you argue online, how you job hunt, how you feel when a new framework drops and yours starts looking old.

This book is about noticing that shift, understanding it, and gently undoing it.
